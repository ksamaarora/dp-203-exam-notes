### Working with Azure Storage Accounts  

#### 1. **Azure Storage Account Overview**  
- A **storage account** is a resource created in Azure to utilize the Azure Storage service.  
- Resources are organized within **resource groups**, which serve as containers for logically grouping resources. These groups hold all the components of an Azure solution.  

#### 2. **Azure Data Center and Storage Management**  
- Storage is hosted in Azure's **data centers**, which are located worldwide.  
- Azure manages the **physical infrastructure**, ensuring reliability and scalability.  
- **Redundancy** is implemented to improve the **availability** and **durability** of your data, protecting against data loss. (keep LRS Locally-redundant storage)

#### 3. **Creating and Using Containers**  
- To upload files to an Azure storage account, you first need to create a **container**.  
  - A **container** acts like a root folder that holds your objects (files and data).  

#### 4. **Uploading Files to a Container**  
- Once a container is created (e.g., named `data`), you can upload files from your local machine.  
- Azure storage accounts can store **unstructured** or **semi-structured** data.  

#### 5. **Changing File Accessibility**  
- After uploading a file (e.g., a `.csv` file), you can modify its **accessibility level**.  
- This determines whether the file can be accessed publicly or privately. For public access, you can view the file using the provided **URL**.  

#### 6. **Accessing Data Programmatically**  
- You can access data stored in Azure storage accounts programmatically, such as reading a CSV file. Below is an example in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd

# URL of the uploaded CSV file
url = "https://appstore4554554.blob.core.windows.net/data/ActivityLog-01.csv"

# Reading the CSV file into a DataFrame
response = pd.read_csv(url)

# Displaying all rows and columns for a comprehensive view
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None) 
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)
print(response)
```

- This code uses **Pandas** to fetch data from the given URL and displays it in a readable format.
