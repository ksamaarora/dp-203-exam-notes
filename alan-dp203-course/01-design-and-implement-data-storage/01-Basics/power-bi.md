4. Connect using an **Account Key**:  
   - Go to your Azure Storage Account in the Azure portal.  
   - Select **Access Keys**.  
   - Copy the **Access Key** and paste it into Power BI.  

5. Complete the connection process to access your data.  

#### 3. **Transforming Data in Power BI**  
- After connecting, you can transform the data to suit your visualization requirements.  
- Use Power BIâ€™s **Transform Data** feature to:  
  - Clean the data (e.g., remove duplicates, fill missing values).  
  - Apply filters and transformations.  
  - Shape the data structure for better visualization.
